Council of torment (CoT) is a Top-Down 2D adventure game with a very rich storyline set during a civil war. Enter the body of a wizard's apprentice and attempt to rid the continent of this war before it escalates. Craft, explore a variety of areas, hunt or just observe the amazing behavior of various NPCs. Anything is possible in Council of Torment. This repository contains the full source code and resources needed to run the game, but they are given as-is, without any setting, project or external libraries. In order to build the engine we used SFML 2.1, TMXParser, custom lua binder and SFNUL.
